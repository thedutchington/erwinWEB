excerpt: Most leadership advice assumes you are at the top. What happens when you are not — and why that position might actually be more powerful?

Every leadership framework I have ever read assumes you are the one at the top. Lead with vision. Inspire the people below you. Set the culture.

But most of us spend most of our lives leading from the middle. You are not the principal. You are not the CEO. You are the ASB sophomore secretary, or the group project coordinator, or the person who shows up early and stays late.

Leading from the middle is different. You cannot mandate. You cannot use authority as a shortcut. You have to actually persuade, inspire, and earn trust every single time.

In my experience as ASB secretary at both San Gorgonio Middle School and Beaumont High School, the most effective thing I could do was not give orders. It was to make the next step obvious. Clear the path, surface the information, and let people who care do what they do best.

The middle is not a waiting room for the top. It is a completely different discipline. Most people who eventually lead well at the top learned how to be exceptional in the middle first.

I would argue that if you want to understand how an organization actually works — its informal power structures, its bottlenecks, who actually gets things done — you learn it by leading from the middle. Not by looking down from above.
