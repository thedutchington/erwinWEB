excerpt: There is a reason students retain more when taught by someone just a few steps ahead of them. Here is the science and the personal reality behind it.

The research on peer learning is compelling. Students taught by near-peers show higher retention rates, deeper conceptual understanding, and more willingness to ask questions than those taught exclusively by credentialed adults.

But why? I think it comes down to two things: proximity and credibility.

When your tutor graduated the same course six months ago, they remember what was confusing. They know which sections of the textbook your teacher skips. They know the tricks that actually work on the tests because they used them too.

I have been tutoring Integrated Math and Chemistry for the past year. The most common thing I hear from students is not "I don't understand this." It is "my teacher explains it in a way that makes sense to them, but not to me." That gap — between how an expert thinks about a subject and how a novice needs to first encounter it — is called the curse of knowledge.

Near-peer tutoring closes that gap. I am close enough to the material to remember struggling with it, and far enough along to help you through it.

If you are in Math 1, 2, or 3, or in Chemistry, that is exactly where I operate. Come prepared with your specific questions, and let's close the gap together.
